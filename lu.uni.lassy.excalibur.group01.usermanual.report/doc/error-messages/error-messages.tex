\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 1}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Ph value is not correct (1)
\subsection{Problem identification}
Ph value is defined on a scale of 1 to 14.  Where 1 is most acidic and 14 most
basic or alkaline.

\subsection{Probable cause}

The problem is due to the constraints on the Ph value text field that means the
value entred here has to be between 1 and 14.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
Enter a valid number between 1 and 14.

\vspace{0.5cm}
Crop Name not valid (2)
\subsection{Problem identification}
The name text field input was not valid.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the Name textfield the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
The name has to be at least 5 caracters long.

\vspace{0.5cm}
Amount no valid input (3)
\subsection{Problem identification}
The amount text field input was not valid.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the amount input the error happend.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 3 you have to enter an amount which is higher than 0.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 4}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Temperature Prefernce is not valid (4)

\subsection{Problem identification}
The entered text field input was not valid.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the Temperature Preference input the error happend.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 4 you have to enter on the Temperature Preference a value
between 15 and 40 degrees.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 5}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Sensor Name not valid (5)
\subsection{Problem identification}
The input of text field Name is not valid.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on  input of Sensor Name text field the error happend.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 5 you have to enter on the Sensor Name Preference a Number at
the end of the input. For good pratice use the Room number where you want to add
it as last index of the sensor name.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 6}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Room input text is not valid (6)
\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error occurs due the non valid input on the Room text field
input.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the on the input the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 6 trouble you have to input on the text field Room a number
which is higher than 0.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 7}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Technician name is not valid (7)

\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error is due to an non valid input on the Name text field.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the input field name the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 7 you have to input on the name text field a name which has
no numbers.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\hrule
\break

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 8}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Reason is not valid (8)
\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error is due to a non valid input on the Reason text field.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the input field Reason the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 8 you have to enter at least a 4 digit long input on the text
field Reason.

\section{{\textcolor{red}{Error message 9}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
Deletion was declined (9)

\subsection{Problem identification}
The manager tries to decline a request.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constrain on the button after pressing it.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 9 you can not delet a request where the value is 0. 0 means
there is no request at the moment.
