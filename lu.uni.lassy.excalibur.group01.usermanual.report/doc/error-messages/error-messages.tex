\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 1}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Ph value is not correct (1)}
\subsection{Problem identification}
Ph value is defined on a scale of 1 to 14.  Where 1 is most acidic and 14 most
basic or alkaline.

\subsection{Probable cause}

The problem is due to the constraints on the Ph value text field that means the
value entred here has to be between 1 and 14.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
Enter a valid number between 1 and 14.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 5}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Sensor Name not valid (5)}
\subsection{Problem identification}
The input of text field Name is not valid.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on  input of Sensor Name text field the error happend.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 5 you have to enter on the Sensor Name Preference a Number at
the end of the input. For good pratice use the Room number where you want to add
it as last index of the sensor name.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 6}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Room input text is not valid (6)}
\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error occurs due the non valid input on the Room text field
input.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the on the input the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 6 trouble you have to input on the text field Room a number
which is higher than 0.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 7}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Technician name is not valid (7)}

\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error is due to an non valid input on the Name text field.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the input field name the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 7 you have to input on the name text field a name which has
no numbers.

\section{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 8}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Reason is not valid (8)}
\subsection{Problem identification}
The cause of the error is due to a non valid input on the Reason text field.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the input field Reason the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 8 you have to enter at least a 4 digit long input on the text
field Reason.

\section{{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 9}}}} 
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Deletion was declined (9)}

\subsection{Problem identification}
The manager tries to decline a request.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constrain on the button after pressing it.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 9 you can not delet a request where the value is 0. 0 means
there is no request at the moment.

\section{{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 10}}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Retriving Failed (10)}

\subsection{Problem identification}
Retriving modify on the crops inventory failed the input amount is the issue.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraint on the amount text field the error happens.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 10 you need to input an amount which is less or equal the
amount left of crops for the given crop which you want to retrive.

\section{{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 11}}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Data Type missmatch (10)}

\subsection{Problem identification}
Retriving modify on the crops inventory failed the input amount is the issue.
Adding an amount of crops needs to be a non decimal number.
\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the constraints on the input on a text field which needs a number and
not a decimal or text value.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the given Error you have to enter an Number which is non decimal.

\section{{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 12}}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Hard disk failure}

\subsection{Problem identification}
The tables aren't displayed on any screen no graphical userinterface.

\subsection{Probable cause}
Due to the life time of hard-disks the 'allocation of data ' the hard-disk
might fail.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 12 the technician should replace the hard-disk by a new one
the data needs to be again loaded on from the back up hard disk.

\section{{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Error message 13}}}}
\hrule
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Empty values inside a table}

\subsection{Problem identification}
There might be the case that there are values inside a list which are null /
empty.

\subsection{Probable cause}
This error might occur due to an human action by trying to add an element to an
element by not compliting the given formular.

\subsection{Corrective actions}
To solve the Error 13 you need to remove the corrupted values from the diffrent
tables by deleting them there are the delete functions to solve these issues.
