\chapter{Software operations}
\label{chap:soptware_operations}


Explain each allowed software operations (i.e. an atomic unit of treatment, a service, a functionality) including a brief description of the operation, required parameters, optional parameters, default options, required steps to trigger the operation, assumptions upon request of the operation and expected results of executing such operation.
Describe how to recognise that the operation has successfully been executed or
abnormally terminated. The template given below (i.e. section \ref{operation:MyOperation} has to be used).

Group the operations devoted to the needs of specific actors. Common
operations to several actors may be grouped and presented once to avoid redundancy.

than 400 nm and the ticker has to be 0.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The LEDS for the given room are turned on until
the outside Lightsensor gives a value more than 400.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Light sensor} sends digital signal of less than 400 nm to the
system.
\item System enables the LEDs for the given room if the TimeTicker is 0.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsection{Example of humidity sensor sending digital signal}
\textbf{Light sensor 1} sends 399 as digital signal. \textbf{System}
evaluates if the timeTicker is 0 if it is it turns the LEDs on.

\label{operation:Turn on watering}

Incase the humidty sensor gives a value below the requested value watering is
turned on.
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Parameters:} humidityLevel,Room
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup with the respected
configurations and digital signals comming from the humidty sensor has to be
less than a given level.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The watering is turned on for the given room.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Humidty sensor} sends digital signal of less than the accepted
amount to the system.
\item System enables the watering for a given room until the humidty level is
as the room humidtyi accepts it.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsection{Example of Enabling wateringl}
\textbf{Humidity sensor 1} sends a value of 10 since the humidity sensor is in
room1.
\textbf{System} enables the watering for the room1 until the humidity level is
40 so that the plants have enough water.
