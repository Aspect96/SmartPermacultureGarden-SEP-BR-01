\section{\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{System}}}
\subsection{Build Temperature Line Diagram}
\label{operation:BuildTemperatureDiagram}
The system draws the line diagram for the temperature of the selected room of
the dropdown menu next to it.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} HistoryOfTemperaturesInAllRooms
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and any actor is logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The corresponding diagram will be drawn and
shown.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If at any time the \emph{statistics} page is accessed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of Build Temperature Line Diagram}
The logged in user wants to see the statistics of the past days.
The user clicks on the \emph{statistics} page in the menu.
The system will now draw the temperature line diagram.




\subsection{Build Current Stock Bar Diagram}
\label{operation:BuildCurrentStockDiagram}
The system draws the bar diagram of the current stock of the inventory.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} CurrentStockOfSeeds
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and any actor is logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The corresponding diagram will be drawn and
shown.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If at any time the \emph{statistics} page is accessed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of Build Current Stock Bar Diagram}
The logged in user wants to see the current stock of the inventory.
The user clicks on the \emph{statistics} page in the menu.
The system will now draw the current stock bar diagram.

\subsection{Build Water Consumption And Luminosity Level Bar And Line Diagram}
\label{operation:BuildWaterConsumptionAndLuminosityLevelDiagram}
The system draws the bar and line diagram for the water consumption in
milliliter and the luminosity level in spectral power of the selected room of
the dropdown menu next to it.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} HistoryOfWaterConsumptionInAllRooms,
HistoryOfLuminosityLevelInAllRooms
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and any actor is logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The corresponding diagram will be drawn and
shown.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If at any time the \emph{statistics} page is accessed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of Build Water Consumption And Luminosity Level Bar And
Line Diagram}
The logged in user wants to see the statistics of the past days.
The user clicks on the \emph{statistics} page in the menu.
The system will now draw the temperature line diagram.




\subsection{Show Crop statistics}
\label{operation:ShowCropStatistics}
The system shows the statistics of the crop \emph{(Date harvested, Plant
harvested, Number of plants harvested, Total weigth of the harvest)} and
calulates the \emph{Average weigth/plant, Days until the plants were harvested
and the growth per day}.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} DatePlanted, DateHarvested, PlantHarvested,
NumberOfPlants, TotalWeigthOfCrop
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and any actor is logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The corresponding information will be calculated
and shown.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If at any time the \emph{statistics} page is accessed.
\item The logged in user chooses a different crop from the crop list on the
\emph{statistics} page.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Example of Show Crop statistics}
The logged in user wants to see the statistics of the past crops.
The user clicks on the \emph{statistics} page in the menu.
The system will now calculate and show the information on the latest crop.
The user wants to see older crops and triggers this system operation by choosing
a different crop.

\subsection{Automatical Creation of Alert for Sensors}
\label{operation:AddAlertForSensors}
The system checks the incoming signal from all the different sensors for invalid
data or no incoming signal.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} SensorData
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} AlertsDatabase is updated with a new entry.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Sensors transmit invalid or impossible data.
\item The Sensors transmit no data.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of Automatical Creation of Alert for Sensors}
The system is bootedup and is monitoring the signal of the sensors.
Now one of the sensors sends invalid data (example: Humidity Sensor sends data
with more than 100 percent humidity) or lost the connection for whatever reason
to the system, an entry will be added into the alerts database.




\subsection{Automatical Creation of Alert for Warnings}
\label{operation:AddAlertForWarnigns}
The system checks the incoming signal from the humidity and temperature sensors
for data which is out of the pre-defined range.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} SensorData
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} AlertsDatabase is updated with a new entry.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Sensors transmit data out of the pre-defined range
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of Automatical Creation of Alert for Warnings}
The system is bootedup and is monitoring the signal of the sensors.
Now the temperature sensors sends a temperature of 18 degrees celsius. The
pre-defined range for the temperature is from 20 to 27 degrees. The system will
add a warning to the alerts database, the temperature is too low.


\subsection{Show projections for watering}
\hrule
\hfill
\vspace{0.5cm}
\label{operation:Show projections for watering}

The System calculates the next planned watering for each room, calculated from the humidity data.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} LogOfHumidity
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and the User has to be
logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The \textbf{User} can see the next watering displayed on the screen.
\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{User} navigates to the projections screen.
\item \textbf{User} navigates to the home screen.

\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of showing projections for watering}
The \textbf{Manager} wants to manage the schedule for the \textbf{Gardener}. The projections for the next planned watering are displayed on the home screen (short version) 
and on the projections screen (long version). The \textbf{Manager} can use these projections to plan the schedule for the \textbf{Gardeners}.

\subsection{Show projections for harvesting}
\hrule
\hfill
\vspace{0.5cm}
\label{operation:Show projections for harvesting}

The System calculates the planned harvest date for each room.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} datePlanted, Plant
\item \textbf{Precondition:} The system is bootedup and the User has to be
logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} The \textbf{User} can see the planned harvest displayed on the screen.
\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{User} navigates to the projections screen.
\item \textbf{User} navigates to the home screen.

\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Example of showing projections for harvesting}
The \textbf{Manager} wants to manage the schedule for the \textbf{Gardener}. The projections for the next planned harvest are displayed on the projections screen. 
The \textbf{Manager} can use these projections to plan the schedule for the \textbf{Gardeners}.
